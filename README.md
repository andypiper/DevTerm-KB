# DevTerm Knowledge Base

A collection of notes, scripts and other information about the [Clockwork Pi DevTerm](https://www.clockworkpi.com/devterm).

Organised per core module. I currently have an R01 RISC-V module (with an A06 on order)

This is not intended to be a replacement for the product wiki, just things I'm learning and doing as I go...
